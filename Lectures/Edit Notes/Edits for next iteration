Lecture 5: 

Smooth after removing lots of the material from Chuck's version. Remove the "guess_max" argument stuff, however, as it was very unintuitive and perhaps not even correct! Instead, provide an example of point-and-click importing with copy/paste.

Lecture 6:

Remove seq_along, as it was confusing and did not add anything! Slighty too much material still it seems, so perhaps key examples simpler!!

Lecture 8:

Fix problem with & conditions!
