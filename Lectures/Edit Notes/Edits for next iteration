Lecture 1:

Perhaps move some of this material to the following week, and give time for installation help/questions after describing packages/files. Not all students were able to install packages easily.

Describe how R is case-sensitive, as this seemed to create issues for some students.

Remove "pander" library and table functions.

Add more organization surrounding the topics covered during lecture.



Lecture 2: 

Went pretty smoothly! Activities were very good here!

In general though, there was too much content! I would push all the data manipulation things
to next week, if possible, to give more time to working with plots. Potentially, switch the order
of lectures 2 and 3?

Lecture 3:

Pretty smooth, but perhaps there is too much info here still! The exercises were great but took up a lot of time.

I would also re-edit the join section, maybe adding an example of full join and showing datasets before/after.

Lecture 5: 

Smooth after removing lots of the material from Chuck's version. Remove the "guess_max" argument stuff, however, as it was very unintuitive and perhaps not even correct! Instead, provide an example of point-and-click importing with copy/paste.

Lecture 6:

Remove seq_along, as it was confusing and did not add anything! Slighty too much material still it seems, so perhaps key examples simpler!!
