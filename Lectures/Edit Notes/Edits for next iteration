Lecture 1:

Perhaps move some of this material to the following week, and give time for installation help/questions after describing packages/files. Not all students were able to install packages easily.

Describe how R is case-sensitive, as this seemed to create issues for some students.

Remove "pander" library and table functions.

Add more organization surrounding the topics covered during lecture.



Lecture 2: 

Went pretty smoothly! Activities were very good here!
