            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              This page contains instructions, deadlines, templates for assignments/peer reviews.
            </p>
            
             
		<h2>Overview:</h2>
	  	<p class="text">
	  	  All assignments should be created using RMarkdown and uploaded to Canvas as both html and Rmd files. Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at and follow all instructions. Use sections for organization, label figures/tables, and use code chunks (e.g., <code>echo</code>, <code>results</code>).
	   	</p>

		<h3>Peer Review:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
	  	  You are required to <b>both grade and provide feedback</b> on a peer's homework each week. Reading/evaluating the work of others is useful and important! Good programmers realize that most problems have been solved by others; the trick is figuring out how to apply existing code to new problems. You will develop this skill by reading others’ code, evaluating their approach to problems, providing suggestions, and pointing out when you learned something new. <b>Good peer reviews</b> give constructive, polite, and insightful comments, are specific and concise, use the grading rubric below, and point out what you learned from their code. <b>Poor peer reviews</b> are impolite or unprofessional, are generic (i.e., could be applied to anyone’s homework), or fail to provide useful suggestions.

		<h3>Rubric Students Use to Grade Assignments:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
	  <br>
		<b>0:</b> Didn’t turn anything in
		<br>
		<b>1:</b> Turned in but low effort, ignoring many directions (less than 50% of assignment completed correctly)
		<br>
		<b>2:</b> Decent effort, followed directions with some minor issues (50-80% of assignment completed correctly)
		<br>
		<b>3:</b> Nailed it (>80% of assignment completed correctly)
		
		<h3>Rubric Instructor Uses to Grade Peer Review:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<br>
		<b>0:</b> Didn't follow any of the instructions below.
		<br>
		<b>1:</b> Peer review was at least one paragraph long, mentions any and all key issues from the assignment, and points out at least one thing positive in your peer's work (and hopefully more!).

		<h3>When to Contact the Instructor:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		A number of situations may warrant contacting the instructor:
		<ol>
 			<li>If you believe you have received an unfair peer review, you can <b>resubmit</b> your homework for evaluation by the instructor. The 
			assignment will be regraded, which may result in a higher, same, or lower grade.</li>
  			<li>If you wish for more feedback on a particular part of the homework, you can ask the instructor for additional explanation <b>without 
			resubmitting</b> during lab or over email.</li>
			<li>If you receive no feedback, the instructor will provide gentle peer review <b>on request</b>.</li>
		</ol>  

		<br>
	      	<h2>Weekly Assignments:</h2>

	      	<h3>Homework 1:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> Write up a .Rmd file showing some exploratory analyses of the Swiss fertility data. Upload both the .Rmd file and the .html 
				file to Canvas. You must upload <i>both</i> for credit. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Mix in-line R calculations, R output, and plots with text describing the relationships you see. Include at least two plots. You must use in-line R calculations at least once (e.g. functions like <code>nrow()</code>, <code>mean()</code>, <code>sd()</code>, 
				<code>cor()</code>, <code>median()</code>, <code>min()</code>) and may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text.
				<br>
				<br>
				Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. 
				Use chunk options <code>echo</code> and <code>results</code> to limit the code/output you show in the .html. 
				Discussion of specific values should be summarized in sentences in your text -- not as printed code and output -- and rounded 
				so as not to be absurdly precise (e.g. round x with <code>round(x, 2)</code>).

		<h3>Homework 2:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> Pick some relationship to look at in the Gapminder data and write up a .Rmd file 
				investigating that question graphically. You might work with a subset of the data (e.g. just Africa). Upload 
				both the <code>.Rmd</code> file and the <code>.html</code> file to Canvas.
				<ul>
					<li>Include 4 to 8 plots.</li>
					<li>All titles, axes, and legends should be labelled clearly (no raw variable names).</li>
					<li>You must have at least one graph with facet_wrap() or facet_grid().</li>
					<li>You must include at least one manually specified legend.</li>
					<li>You can use other geoms like histograms, bar charts, add vertical or horizontal lines, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization. You must write up your observations 
				in words as well as showing the graphs. Use chunk options like <code>echo=FALSE</code> to limit the code/output you 
				show in the <code>.html</code>.</li>
  			<li><b>Homework Due Date:</b> 4/12</li>
			<li><b>Peer Review Due Date:</b> 4/17</li>

		<h3>Homework 3:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
 			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> Pick something to look at in the <code>nycflights13</code> data and write up a .Rmd file showing your investigation. Upload both the .Rmd file and the .html file to Canvas. 
 			
 			You must:
 			<ul>
					<li>Use each of the following functions at least once: <code>mutate()</code>, <code>summarize()</code>, <code>group_by()</code>, and <code>left_join()</code>. </li>
					<li>Include at least one nicely formatted plot (<code>ggplot2</code>) and at least one nicely formatted table (<code>pander</code>). In plots and tables, use "nice" variable names (try out spaces!) and rounded values (<= 3 digits).</li>
					<li>Briefly write down your question, observations from your analyses, and a summary of your work in words.</li>
			</ul>
      This time, <i>include all your code in your output document</i> (<code>echo=TRUE</code>), using comments and line breaks separating commands so that it is clear to a peer what you are doing (or trying to do!).</li>

		<h3>Homework 4:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
 			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> Fill in the RMarkdown template below that walks you through the process of creating, accessing, and manipulating R data structures. Enter values in the RMarkdown document and knit it to check your answers!
 			<ul>
 			  <li>*Knit after entering each answer!!*  If you get an error, check to see if undoing your last edit solves the problem. Coding an assignment to handle all possible mistakes is really hard! </li>
 			  <li>This assignment is also long, so *start early*.</li>
 			</ul>
 			On the due date, I will provide a key for the written answers. You will grade those answers as part of your peer review. In addition, you'll be asked to comment on the style of your peer's code and what you yourself did similarly/different. Please remember to provide a numerical grade (0-3), as always.</li>

		<h3>Homework 9 <i>(Optional Extra Credit)</i>:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
 			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> For extra credit, you will revise and resubmit one of your previous homework assignments. You may gain up to 4 extra credit points. For each, please do the following:
 			<ul>
 			  <li>Write a 3 paragraph response to your initial assignment. The first paragraph should be a reflection of your peer reviewer's comments, if available (if not, compare your work to that which you were asked to peer review). The second paragraph should be a thoughtful explanation of your own work after viewing the key. What did you struggle with initially, and why? How could your initial work be improved? The third paragraph should provide a detailed description of what has been updated in your revised submission.</li>
 			  <li>Revise and resubmit your original work, being sure all requirements of the original assignment have been met and that all work appears professional and polished. Don't just copy the key, but provide an original submission in your own coding style.</li>
 			  <li>Submit the updated files on the Canvas assignment for Homework 9 (<b>not</b> the original assignment), being sure to add your written response at the beginning of your updated assignment .Rmd and .html files.</li>
 			</ul>
 			</li>
  			<li><b>Homework "Due" Date:</b> 6/5 (midnight)</li>
