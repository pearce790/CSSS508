            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              On this page, you'll find instructions, deadlines, and templates for all homework assignments and subsequent peer reviews.
            </p>
            
             
		<h2>Overview:</h2>
	  	<p class="text">
		All homeworks will be created using RMarkdown and uploaded to Canvas as both .html and .rmd files. You are expected to mix in-line R calculations, tables, 
		R output, and plots with text as appropriate. You must use in-line R calculations/references (e.g. with functions 
			like <code>nrow()</code>, <code>mean()</code>, etc.) and 
		may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text.
		<br>
		<br>
		Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. 
			Use chunk options 
		<code>echo</code> and <code>results</code> to limit the code and output you show in the .html. Discussion of specific values 
			should be summarized in sentences in your text–not as printed 
		code and output–and rounded (for instance, using <code>round()</code>) so as not to be absurdly precise.
	   	</p>

		<h3>Evaluation via Peer Review:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		For each homework assignment, completed assignments will be randomly assigned to peer reviewers. They will provide feedback and a score between 0 and 3 points 
		according to the rubric below. 75% of your overall course grade comes from your peer's evaluation of your homework!
		<br>
		<br>

			You are required to <i>both grade and provide feedback</i> on both the .html output and .Rmd syntax files for your peer's homework. The ability to read and evaluate the work 
		of others is important and useful. A good programmer realizes that most coding problems have been solved by others in the past; the trick is figuring out how to 
		read existing code and apply it to new problems. You will begin to develop this skill by reading others’ code, evaluating their approach to problems, providing 
		suggestions, and pointing out when you learned something new.
		<br>
		<br>
		When providing feedback, <i>good peer reviews</i> (1) give constructive, polite, and insightful comments, (2) are specific and concise, (3) use the grading rubric and 
		guidelines below, and (4) point out where you learned from their code, if you did. <i>Poor peer reviews</i> (1) are impolite or unprofessional, (2) are generic or non-specific, 		i.e., could be applied to anyone’s homework, (3) fail to offer praise, show what you learned, or provide useful suggestions.
		<br>
		<br>
		The instructor will grade each peer review critically on a binary "good" / "not good" scale. You should not see these as "easy" points!
	   	</p>

		<h3>Grading Rubric:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		Homework will be evaluated by peers on a 0 to 3 scale. The overall scores are shown below with example situations in bullets below each:
		<br>
		<br>
		0: Didn’t turn anything in
		<br>
		1: Turned in but low effort, ignoring many directions
		<ul>
              		<li>No attempt made on any one problem.</li>
			<li>Attempts made on all problems but nothing worked.</li>
			<li>.html file did not knit / was not provided.</li>
			<li>.Rmd file not provided.</li>
            	</ul>
		2: Decent effort, followed directions with some minor issues
		<ul>
              		<li>Some code fails to work, but a reasonable attempt was made.</li>
			<li>.html file knitted but is poorly formatted.</li>
			<li>.Rmd syntax is disorganized or hard to follow.</li>
            	</ul>
		3: Nailed it
		<ul>
              		<li>All problems answered with no errors or omissions.</li>
			<li>Code and output are clearly organized.</li>
			<li>Clever or elegant solutions used</li>
            	</ul>

	   	</p>

		<h3>When to Contact the Instructor:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		A number of situations may warrant contacting the instructor:
		<ol>
 			<li>If you believe you have received an unfair peer review, you can <b>resubmit</b> your homework for evaluation by the instructor. The 
			assignment will be regraded, which may result in a higher, same, or lower grade.</li>
  			<li>If you wish for more feedback on a particular part of the homework, you can ask the instructor for additional explanation <b>without 
			resubmitting</b> during lab or over email.</li>
			<li>If you receive no feedback, the instructor will provide gentle peer review <b>on request</b>.</li>
		</ol>  
	   	</p>

	      	<h2>Weekly Assignments:</h2>

	      	<h3>Homework 1:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> Write up a .Rmd file showing some exploratory analyses of the Swiss fertility data. Upload both the .Rmd file and the .html 
				file to Canvas. You must upload <i>both</i> for credit. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Mix in-line R calculations, tables, R output, and plots with text describing the relationships you see. Include at least one plot and one table. You are encouraged to include more! 
				You must use in-line R calculations/references at least once (e.g. functions like <code>nrow()</code>, <code>mean()</code>, <code>sd()</code>, 
				<code>cor()</code>, <code>median()</code>, <code>min()</code>) and may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text.
				<br>
				<br>
				Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. 
				Use chunk options <code>echo</code> and <code>results</code> to limit the code/output you show in the .html. 
				Discussion of specific values should be summarized in sentences in your text -- not as printed code and output -- and rounded 
				so as not to be absurdly precise (e.g. round x with <code>round(x, 2)</code>).
