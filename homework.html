            <p class="text">
              This page contains instructions, deadlines, templates for assignments/peer reviews.
            </p>
            
             
		<h2>Overview:</h2>
	  	<p class="text">
	  	  All assignments should be created using RMarkdown and uploaded to Canvas as both html and Rmd files. Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at and follow all instructions. Use sections for organization, label figures/tables, and use code chunks (e.g., <code>echo</code>, <code>results</code>).
	   	</p>

		<h3>Peer Review:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
	  	  You are required to <b>both grade and provide feedback</b> on a peer's homework each week. Reading/evaluating the work of others is useful and important! Good programmers realize that most problems have been solved by others; the trick is figuring out how to apply existing code to new problems. You will develop this skill by reading others’ code, evaluating their approach to problems, providing suggestions, and pointing out when you learned something new. <b>Good peer reviews</b> give constructive, polite, and insightful comments, are specific and concise, use the grading rubric below, and point out what you learned from their code. <b>Poor peer reviews</b> are impolite or unprofessional, are generic (i.e., could be applied to anyone’s homework), or fail to provide useful suggestions.

		<h3>Rubric Students Use to Grade Assignments:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
	  <br>
		<b>0:</b> Didn’t turn anything in
		<br>
		<b>1:</b> Turned in but low effort, ignoring many directions (less than 50% of assignment completed correctly)
		<br>
		<b>2:</b> Decent effort, followed directions with some minor issues (50-80% of assignment completed correctly)
		<br>
		<b>3:</b> Nailed it (>80% of assignment completed correctly)
		
		<h3>Rubric Instructor Uses to Grade Peer Review:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<br>
		<b>0:</b> Didn't follow all of the instructions below.
		<br>
		<b>1:</b> Peer review was at least one paragraph long, mentions any and all key issues from the assignment, and points out at least one thing positive in your peer's work (and hopefully more!).

		<h3>When to Contact the Instructor:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		A number of situations may warrant contacting the instructor:
		<ol>
 			<li>If you believe you have received an unfair peer review, you can <b>resubmit</b> your homework for evaluation by the instructor. The 
			assignment will be regraded, which may result in a higher, same, or lower grade.</li>
  			<li>If you wish for more feedback on a particular part of the homework, you can ask the instructor for additional explanation <b>without 
			resubmitting</b> during lab or over email.</li>
			<li>If you receive no feedback, the instructor will provide gentle peer review <b>on request</b>.</li>
		</ol>  

		<br>
	      	<h2>Weekly Assignments:</h2>

	      	<h3>Homework 1:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> Write up a .Rmd file showing some exploratory analyses of the Swiss fertility data. Upload both the .Rmd file and the .html 
				file to Canvas. You must upload <i>both</i> for credit. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Mix in-line R calculations, R output, and plots with text describing the relationships you see. Include at least two plots. You must use in-line R calculations at least once (e.g. functions like <code>nrow()</code>, <code>mean()</code>, <code>sd()</code>, 
				<code>cor()</code>, <code>median()</code>, <code>min()</code>) and may not hard-code any numbers referenced in your text.
				<br>
				<br>
				Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization using sections or lists, and all plots labeled clearly. 
				Use chunk options <code>echo</code> and <code>results</code> to limit the code/output you show in the .html. 
				Discussion of specific values should be summarized in sentences in your text -- not as printed code and output -- and rounded 
				so as not to be absurdly precise (e.g. round x with <code>round(x, 2)</code>).

		<h3>Homework 2:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
		  <li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> In this homework, you'll pose a question regarding the Gapminder dataset and investigate it graphically. 
		  <ul>
					<li>At the beginning of your document, write down a research question that is based on the Gapminder dataset (e.g., "How does population change over time in different countries?")</li>
					<li>Create 3-6 plots to answer/investigate your research question. Consider histograms (<code>geom_histogram()</code>), scatterplots (<code>geom_point()</code>), or lineplots (<code>geom_line()</code>).</li>
					<li>Be sure all titles, axes, and legends are clearly labelled.</li>
					<li>Include at least one plot with <code>facet_wrap()</code> or <code>facet_grid()</code>.</li>
			</ul>
		  Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at, with some organization. You must write up your observations in words as well as showing the graphs. Upload both the <code>.Rmd</code> file and the <code>.html</code> file to Canvas.

		<h3>Homework 3:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
 			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> Create an RMarkdown file (from scratch this time!) in which you answer each of the following questions. Be sure to display <b>all your code in the knitted</b> version (use throughout <code>echo=TRUE</code>). 
 			Remember, the package <code>nycflights13</code> contains data on flights originating in NYC during the year 2013. There are three airports servicing NYC: JFK, LGA ("LaGuardia"), and EWR ("Newark").
 			<ul>
 			  <li>Choose an airport outside New York, and count how many flights went to that airport from NYC in 2013. How many of those flights started at JFK, LGA, and EWR? (Hint: Use <code>filter</code>, <code>group_by</code>, and <code>summarize</code>)</li>
 			  <li>The variable <code>arr_delay</code> contains arrival delays in minutes (negative values represent early arrivals). Make a ggplot histogram displaying arrival delays for 2013 flights from NYC to the airport you chose.</li>
 			  <li>Use <code>left_join</code> to add weather data at departure to the subsetted data (Hint 1: Match on <code>origin</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, and <code>hour</code>!!). Calculate the mean temperature by month at departure (<code>temp</code>) across all flights (Hint 2: Use <code>mean(temp,na.rm=T)</code> to have R calculate an average after ignoring missing data values).</li>
 			  <li>Investigate if there is a relationship between departure delay (<code>dep_delay</code>) and wind speed (<code>wind_speed</code>). Is the relationship different between JFK, LGA, and EWR? I suggest answering this question by making a plot and writing down a one-sentence interpretation.</li>
 			</ul>
 			As always, submit both the .Rmd and knitted .html to Canvas.

		<h3>Homework 4:</h3>
	  	<p class="text">
		<ul>
 			<li><b>Homework Instructions:</b> Fill in the RMarkdown template below that walks you through the process of creating, accessing, and manipulating R data structures. Enter values in the RMarkdown document and knit it to check your answers!
 			<ul>
 			  <li>*Knit after entering each answer!!*  If you get an error, check to see if undoing your last edit solves the problem. Coding an assignment to handle all possible mistakes is really hard! </li>
 			  <li>This assignment is also long, so *start early*.</li>
 			</ul>
 			On the due date, I will provide a key for the written answers. You will grade those answers as part of your peer review. In addition, you'll be asked to comment on the style of your peer's code and what you yourself did similarly/different. Please remember to provide a numerical grade (0-3), as always.</li>
