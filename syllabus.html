            <h3>Overview and Learning Objectives:</h3>
	 	<p class="text">
              	This course is intended to give students a foundational understanding of programming in the statistical language R. This knowledge is 
		intended to be broadly useful wherever you encounter data in your education and career. General topics we will focus on include:
		<ul>
              		<li>Exploring data with graphics and summaries</li>
			<li>Cleaning and preparing data for analyses</li>
			<li>Linking data sets together</li>
			<li>Organizing projects and creating reproducible research</li>
            	</ul>
		By the end of this course you should feel confident approaching any data you encounter in the future. We will cover almost no 
		statistics, however it is the intention that this course will leave you prepared to progress in CSSS or STAT courses with the 
		ability to focus on statistics instead of coding. Additionally, the basic concepts you learn will be applicable to other 
		programming languages and research in general, such as logic and algorithmic thinking.
            	</p>
            
        
            <h3>Structure:</h3>

            <p class="text">
              	This course has two 110 minute sessions each week: Lecture and Lab. 
		<ul>
              		<li>Lecture: On Thursdays, I will lead a collaborative session on a specific topic to help you learn fundamental
			skills, concepts, and principles for learning R. Due to the length of the session, the lecture will usually consist of
			two 50 minute lectures with a 10 minute break in between. Most lectures will involve some sort of interactive component,
			which may include exploring data, writing code, and small group discussions.</li>
			<li>Lab: On Tuesdays, I will hold an unstructured lab session for working on homework assignments, reviewing previous weeks'
			material, and asking questions. Students will work with each other to learn and practice key skills in R, but I will be 
			available to help as well! Labs are optional but highly recommended.</li>
            	</ul>
		The content from lecture each week will form the basis on your homework assignment for the following week. I expect you will work on
		the assignment before and/or during the next lab session. Homework will be due on Thursdays, usually one week after it is assigned (exceptions for holidays).
            </p>
	      
	    <h3>Schedule:</h3>

            <p class="text">
	    Below is a summary of topics that will be covered each week in lecture. Labs (Tuesdays) will focus on material covered in the previous
		    lecture, unless otherwise stated below.
		<ul>
              		<li>Week 0 (Th 9/29): Introduction to R, RStudio, and RMarkdown </li>
			<li>Week 1 (Th 10/6): Visualizing Data (HW 1 assigned)</li>
			<li>Week 2 (Th 10/13): Manipulating and Summarizing Data (HW 1 due; HW 2 assigned)</li>
			<li>Week 3 (Th 10/20): Understanding R Data Structures (HW 2 due; HW 3 assigned)</li>
			<li>Week 4 (Th 10/27): Importing, Exporting, and Cleaning Data (HW 3 due; HW 4 assigned)</li>
			<li>Week 5 (Th 11/3): Using Loops (HW 4 due; HW 5 assigned</li>
			<li>Week 6 (Th 11/10): Writing Functions (HW 5 due; HW 6 assigned)</li>
			<li>Week 7 (Th 11/17): Working with Text Data (HW 6 due; HW 7 assigned)</li>
			<li>Week 8 (Th 11/24): Thanksgiving Holiday (No class; no HW due; following lab will review past homeworks) </li>
			<li>Week 9 (Th 12/1): Working with Geographical Data (HW 7 due; HW 8 assigned)</li>
			<li>Week 10 (Th 12/8): Reproducibility and Model Results (HW 8 due)</li>
            	</ul>
            </p>
	    
	    <h3>Materials and Texts:</h3>
	    <p class="text">
              	This course has no required materials or texts. However, there are a few things to note:
		<ul>
              		<li>Laptops: This course is primarily focused on computation. As a result, it is helpful to bring a personal laptop to
			class each day. Alternatively, you can use one of the computers available in the classroom (Savery 117, aka the "CSSCR Big Lab").
			If you'd like a laptop but do not have one, you can borrow one for free from UW through the 
			<a href="https://stlp.uw.edu/">Student Technology Loan Program</a>.</li>
			<li>Materials: This course has no required textbooks, but there are many helpful resources available for free online. Two of
			my favorites are the textbook<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham and
			the short manuals <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">R Cheat Sheets</a> by the folks at RStudio.</li>
            	</ul>
		The content from lecture each week will form the basis on your homework assignment for the following week. I expect you will work on
		the assignment before and/or during the next lab session. Homework will be due on Thursdays, usually one week after it is assigned (exceptions for holidays).
